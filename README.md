## Welcome to VueJS Athens!

Vue.js is a progressive javascript framework for building user interfaces. Its success depends on its limited size and its gentle learning curve. Our goal is to build a community that is eager to learn more about Vue.js, understand how it works under the hood and also share knowledge.
Every level of developer is welcome.
