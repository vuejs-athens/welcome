# Code of Conduct

VueJS Athens is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, race, nationality, or religious beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the VueJS Athens organizers.

All attendees, speakers, sponsors, instructors, and volunteers at our events are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Leadership will enforce this code at all times. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

If you have questions or feedback about this Code of Conduct please contact the organizers.

## Meetups

Our meetups are dedicated to provide a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices.

Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, race, nationality, or religious beliefs, deliberate intimidation, threats, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any VueJS Athens event or communication channel. Community members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in harassing behavior, the VueJS Athens organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from the VueJS Athens community, and/or removal from an event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an VueJS Athens organizer immediately, or as soon as you feel comfortable doing so.

## Workshops

Our workshops are also dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices.

However, the reason for this section is that there are some specific things we'd like to address there are a few special addendums that we felt was necessary to address as well.

## Sponsorship

VueJS Athens does not receive or manipulates any money from its sponsors.
The group communicates the needs of a meetup event to its sponsor and the sponsor makes the necessary arrangements.

If you wish to sponsor one of our events, feel free to contact us at vuejsathens@gmail.com, and we will reach you out.

### Organizers

Organizers are expected to provide a safe environment for all participants of the workshop.

### Participants

1.  **Only provide feedback when a fellow participant requests it**. Not everyone wants to hear feedback from people other than the instructor. Please respect this.

2.  **When providing feedback, be constructive.** Trollish, kurt, or huffy interactions will be broken up. We are all friends here.

3.  **Don't share other participant' work unless they explicitly say that it is ok.** You can and should ask!

4.  **Refrain from posting antagonizing words and work.** This includes hostile posts and art on topics of ethnicity, gender orientation, religion; unwanted sexual advances; being a troll; leaving hurtful and nasty feedback for other participants.

    * If you're upsetting someone, you will get a warning to Knock It Off and correct your behavior and/or remove your work (or we will do it for you). There are no second warnings. If someone complains a second time, you will be asked to leave, no complaints, no tears.

    * For particularly hopeless and offensive people, we reserve the right to take action without issuing a warning to preserve the peace. Once again, no complaints or tears.

5.  **If someone's behavior is upsetting you, let us know.** We can and will intervene. Don't try to be a hero and bottle it up inside. Friction between two participants can disrupt the entire class's dynamic. The sooner it's addressed, the healthier and happier all participants will be. Contact us at vuejsathens@gmail.com, and we will privately hear you out.
